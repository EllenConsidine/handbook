## GitHub presence

A GitHub organization is a shared account where all organization members can collaborate across many projects at once. NSAPH has five organizations on GitHub meant to help you find and use group resources:

1. [NSAPH Projects](https://github.com/NSAPH-Projects) - meant to collect data analyses; 
2. [NSAPH Software](https://github.com/orgs/NSAPH-Software) - for the development of reusable software packages for analysis; 
3. [NSAPH Data Platform](https://github.com/NSAPH-Data-Platform) - captures all the code that went into creating and maintaining the data platform; 
4. [NSAPH Data Processing](https://github.com/NSAPH-Data-Processing) - meant to capture the data pipelines for data transformations and aggregation;
5. [NSAPH](https://github.com/NSAPH) - gathers past projects but will continue to be used for miscellaneous projects that don't belong in the previous categories

## The Causal Rule Ensemble Method (CRE)

"The CRE Package, written in R and available on GitHub, implements the recently developed Causal Rule Ensemble (CRE) algorithm, a flexible and precise method for denovo subgroup discovery. The CRE approach focuses on identifying drivers of treatment heterogeneity in observational or randomized studies in the presence of an intervention or treatment."

-- [CRE official documentation](https://fasrc.github.io/CRE/) and [GitHub repository](https://github.com/fasrc/CRE).


## CausalGPS

"An R package for implementing matching on generalized propensity scores with continuous exposures. We developed an innovative approach for estimating causal effects using observational data in settings with continuous exposures, and introduce a new framework for GPS caliper matching that jointly matches on both the estimated GPS and exposure levels to fully adjust for confounding bias."

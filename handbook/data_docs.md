# Documenting data

## Data dictionary

## Data diagram
Data diagram tools are useful to document data processing flows and some can be embedded into Markdown files. For example, [Mermaid](https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid#readme) and [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com).

By using diagram tools:
* modifications to flowcharts do not have to be re-uploaded with new images every time.
* Markdown syntax is intuitive therefore documentation process is more efficient. 

See [examples](https://github.com/NSAPH-Data-Processing/sql-utils/tree/develop/docs) of Data Filtering and Data Integration diagrams created by `mermaid`.
